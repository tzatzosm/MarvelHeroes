# Marvel Heroes

[Gif showcasing UI here](/External/Readme.md)

## Sample application exploring Swift Concurrency

### Running the project

1. Generate a set of API keys at [marvel developer portal](https://developer.marvel.com)
2. Update [APIKeys.plist](/AsyncAwaitMarvelHeroes/Resources/APIKeys.plist) with the generated keys  

### UI design pattern

I chose VIPER as the design pattern for this project since I haven't used it before and would like to understand it a bit better.
 
I also used [VIPER-Xcode-Templates](https://github.com/infinum/iOS-VIPER-Xcode-Templates) to generate the boilerplate for my modules.
